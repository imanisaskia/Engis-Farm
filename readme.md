# Engi's Farm

## Description
Would you rather stick to a business you've been managing for almost a year and is currently thriving, or move to an obscure farm passed down to you from your grandfather *ten years ago*? Pshh, is that even a question? Of course you'd throw your life away for that farm. That's exactly what Engi did.

**Engi's Farm** is a farming simulation. The player, 'Engi', grows grass, interacts with animals, gains and processes products and sells them to earn money. Animals include chickens, ducks, cows, goats, pigs, and rabbits. The simulation reaches an end when the animal count reaches zero.
